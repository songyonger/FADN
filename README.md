# FADN
An unofficial code for paper "Learning Frequency-aware Dynamic Network for Efficient Super-Resolution". I've implemented the learnable frequency mask part (the dilated frequency mask  on the highest frequency branch is not implemented).  And there is no specific threshold for manual DCT frequency masks so that part is not implemented. The code is based on https://github.com/sanghyun-son/EDSR-PyTorch
